Catallax trust-maxxes. Rather than involving blockchains, smart contracts or complicated oracles and voting systems, the Catallax protocol relies on lindy technology: **trust and reputation.**

Tasks and their resolutions are posted on the [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) protocol while payments are handled via [Cashu ecash](https://cashu.space/) and [Lightning](https://lightning.network/).  
Thanks to [Cashu-based wallets](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/60.md) and Nostr's permissionless identity creation, anyone (namedoxxed or nym) can participate in the Catallax economy without KYC nor first having a Bitcion or Lightning wallet configured.  

**All you need is a web browser.**

## Protocols over Platforms

Catallax is a protocol, not a platform. This site acts as a schelling point to coordinate and explain the system, but doesn't provide the service itself nor does the author take any fees. It's up to market actors to participate in the protocol.

Because the network is built on top of Nostr, Catallax inherits Nostr's censorship-resistance. As long as you can find a relay (or run your own), you can participate in the economy. Neither individual users nor particular task categories can be unilaterally prohibited by any central authority.  
Speech is guaranteed by open protocols, but reach is not.
