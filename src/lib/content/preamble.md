This site explains an open protocol called _Catallax_ which is intended to facilitate uncensorable, decentralized labor markets and permissionless payments.

Anybody on Earth can participate in Catallax and nobody can be stopped from doing so by anyone. Those who choose to participate in Catallax do so as one of the following roles, depending on their goals:

- **Patron**: Creates tasks to be worked, finalizes agreements with **Arbiters**, funds escrows and assigns **Free Agents**.
- **Arbiter**: Advertises as an escrow agent, accepts tasks, judges outcomes of work and pays **Free Agents** or refunds **Patrons**.
- **Free Agent**: Applies for available tasks, delivers work and gets paid.

Arbiter advertisements, Task postings and their eventual resolutions are posted on the [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) protocol while payments are handled via [Cashu ecash](https://cashu.space/) and [Lightning](https://lightning.network/).  
Thanks to [Cashu-based wallets](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/60.md) and Nostr's permissionless identity creation, anyone (namedoxxed or nym) can participate in the Catallax economy without conforming to [KYC or AML](https://www.dowjones.com/professional/risk/resources/glossary/kyc-vs-aml) nor first having a Bitcion or Lightning wallet configured.  

**All you need is a web browser.**

Rather than involving blockchains, smart contracts or complicated oracles and voting systems, the Catallax protocol relies on lindy technology: **trust and reputation.**
