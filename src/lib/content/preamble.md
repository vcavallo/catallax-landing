Catallax trust-maxxes. Rather than involving blockchains, smart contracts or complicated oracles and voting systems, the Catallax protocol relies on lindy technology: **trust and reputation.**

Tasks and their resolutions are posted on the [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) protocol while payments are handled via [Cashu ecash](https://cashu.space/) and [Lightning](https://lightning.network/).  
Thanks to [Cashu-based wallets](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/60.md) and Nostr's permissionless identity creation, anyone (namedoxxed or nym) can participate in the Catallax economy without KYC nor first having a Bitcion or Lightning wallet configured.  

All you need is a web browser.
