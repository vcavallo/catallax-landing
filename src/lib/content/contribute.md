We are very much looking for contributors to help take this over the finish line.

Until we get the rest of our coordination and comms in place, the best way to get involved is to tag [me](https://njump.me/npub19ma2w9dmk3kat0nt0k5dwuqzvmg3va9ezwup0zkakhpwv0vcwvcsg8axkl) in a nostr post. Consider using the hashtag `#catallax`, too?

- TODO: GitHub Discussion (general comments or suggestions)
